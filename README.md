# simplegame

This is a really simple game I made in order to learn more about... how to make a game. Simple stuff like processing input,
moving objects around a board, collision detection, etc. I found it to be a good learning experience.

You can see the game at http://reprehensible.github.io/simplegame/

It's actually kind of fun to play for a few minutes, which is mostly a happy accident.

## dependencies

A modern web browser. That's it. It uses no third party libraries of any kind.
